# council-catalog

The city of San Jose hosts the agendas of city council meetings on its [website](http://www.sanjoseca.gov/index.aspx?NID=5322). Currently, the agendas are organized only by date. This means that anyone who wants to access specific information about agenda items from past meetings needs to know the date of the meeting, or else spend a lot of time manually searching through agendas. This project aims to make information within the agendas more accessible by providing a service that crawls the agendas and creates an organized data structure for agenda items which can then be searched/filtered/etc. in a much more user-friendly way.
